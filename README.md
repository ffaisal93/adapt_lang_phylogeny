This work is done on the fork of Adapter-Hub.
- Adapter-Hub version installation for evaluation in install.sh 
- Phylogeny training, evaluation and Modified AdapterHub scripts are in `new_scripts/` and `slurm_scripts/` folder.
- language and trained adapter schemas are in `meta_files/`
- Detailed instruction to train, evaluate with trained models are coming soon `[check around May 30, 2022]`
